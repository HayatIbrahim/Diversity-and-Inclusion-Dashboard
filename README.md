# Diversity-and-Inclusion-Dashboard
I recently completed a job simulation internship with PwC Switzerland, where I developed a dynamic four-page Diversity and Inclusion Dashboard. This comprehensive tool highlights key metrics and visualizations, offering insights into hiring, promotions, leavers and performance ratings. Each element is carefully crafted to provide a clear, impactful presentation of diversity and inclusion data.
KPIs:
The main KPIs in Hiring Dashboard I included are the total number of employees (broken down by male and female), total new hires, and the gender breakdown of these hires.
Charts:
I used a stacked bar chart to show new hires by job title and gender. It reveals that the largest number of hires is in junior officer roles, where the majority are female. At the executive level, there are four males hired, but no females, showing a clear gap at the top.
Another stacked bar chart shows new hires by department and gender. The operations department had the highest number of hires, with 17 females and 12 males.
I included a pie chart to show the percentage of male and female hires, with females making up 51.52% of the new hires.
For a more detailed look, I used a line and stacked column chart to display the total new hires alongside the male and female breakdown.
The final chart is also a line and column stacked chart, which shows total new hires versus old hires by year. All new hires (66 in total) occurred in 2020.
Next Dashboard is Promotion Dashboard in this Key KPIs highlight the total number of employees promoted, including a breakdown by gender and the corresponding percentages of male and female promotions.
Key highlights include:
A 100% stacked bar chart that showcases promotion rates by job title, revealing that 87.5% of executive-level promotions were male, with males leading in most levels except junior officer roles, where females were promoted the most.
A cluster column chart depicting promotion trends by department for FY20 vs FY21, with both operations and sales/marketing seeing 16 promotions in FY21, while sales/marketing promotions jumped from 9 in FY20 to 19 in FY21.
Additional charts like line and cluster column visualizations track employee gender distribution by job title after FY20 and FY21 promotions.
These dashboard provides a comprehensive view of the promotion landscape, with clear insights into gender representation and departmental trends.
Alongside the Promotion and Hiring Dashboard, Iâ€™ve also developed two additional dashboards focusing on Leavers and Performance Rating. These dashboards provide a clear and detailed visualization of employee exits and performance assessments, further enriching the overall analysis of workforce dynamics can be seen in image clearly.
